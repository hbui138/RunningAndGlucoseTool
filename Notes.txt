The main motivation in this study is to find out potential cases how to support patients with diabetes in
their everyday lives. Especially, focusing on the effect of physical exercise on the glucose level: can
we create an alarm system that would warn if the exercise is heavy and a patient may need a snack. 
To accomplish this, you need to take these steps:

1.	Try to get an understanding of what is a normal glucose time series for diabetic and healthy people. 
Select five of each with similar background information and find Monday-Tuesday time spans and plot them.

2.	Figure out, how to get a daily exercise pattern automatically: is it a time how much each activity 
type was done daily? Can you find this way people, who have had harder exercise at some point of the 
measurement period, and thus, they are the most interesting ones.

3.	Try to find some literature to support the hypothesis: how the exercise affects the blood glucose and 
what kind of research there is on this topic.

--------------------------
So far:
4 groups: For now ok to combine
- Pre diabetes lifestyle controlled
- Healthy
- Oral medication or non-insulin injectable medication controlled
- Insulin dependent

About BMI
Underweight (Severe thinness)	< 16.0
Underweight (Moderate thinness)	16.0–16.9
Underweight (Mild thinness)	17.0–18.4
Normal range	18.5–24.9
Overweight (Pre-obese)	25.0–29.9
Obese (Class I)	30.0–34.9
Obese (Class II)	35.0–39.9
Obese (Class III)	≥ 40.0


Age range from 55-65 since it is the age range that most people first get diabetes
Age range from 35-45 seems to be the most active with activity

Can choose both to compare (priority 55-65)
----------------------------
TODO:

- Get categories of avtivity names:
                # "activity_name": "",
                # "activity_name": "generic",
                # "activity_name": "running",
                # "activity_name": "sedentary",
                # "activity_name": "walking",

Select from each study group some patients who are most active and see compare their glucose level on day 
they do activities compare to other days (label first then steps) (how long it takes) (Can label running 
as 1 and other activities as 0 and find time where consecutive running occur. Can tolerate 15-30 mins 
disruption)

Narrow the common time for patients instead of using relative time ticks

- Check how many people are obese in each group using BMI
- Make a function to select a number of patients from each group with similar background (age, BMI)
- Check their activity rate from a specific dates (can make a slider to change chosen timeframe)
- Compare to see average time each person do specific kind of activity


- Maybe using simple AI model for prediction (regression (linear, softmax), random forest, decision tree, )
- Maybe plot to see a threshold for activity that at that threshold, glucose level drop below a specific 
number. Then when a sensor notice a person doing too much activity (considering category also such as 
walking, running), it let them know (use average across patients or other methods)


Method: Select X sample from each group with similar background. Plot their glucose during specific 
timestamp

- Assume running has most effect on glucose (Focus on running only)



For the activity sessions: Getting the min and max 10 mins before and after 


--------------------------------------
Plan for next meeting: Focus on the model and if something not working, leave it to discussion
For model:
    Input: 

About the test, do we care if 2 or more entry is from a same person? Like 2 entry with 1 have higher glucose
after exercise and 1 with lower but from the same person.

Question: Do we actually consider pre diabetes diabetes? Should we keep old group or not?
