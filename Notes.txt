The main motivation in this study is to find out potential cases how to support patients with diabetes in
their everyday lives. Especially, focusing on the effect of physical exercise on the glucose level: can
we create an alarm system that would warn if the exercise is heavy and a patient may need a snack. 
To accomplish this, you need to take these steps:

1.	Try to get an understanding of what is a normal glucose time series for diabetic and healthy people. 
Select five of each with similar background information and find Monday-Tuesday time spans and plot them.

2.	Figure out, how to get a daily exercise pattern automatically: is it a time how much each activity 
type was done daily? Can you find this way people, who have had harder exercise at some point of the 
measurement period, and thus, they are the most interesting ones.

3.	Try to find some literature to support the hypothesis: how the exercise affects the blood glucose and 
what kind of research there is on this topic.

--------------------------
So far:
4 groups: 
- Pre diabetes lifestyle controlled
- Healthy
- Oral medication or non-insulin injectable medication controlled
- Insulin dependent

About BMI
Underweight (Severe thinness)	< 16.0
Underweight (Moderate thinness)	16.0–16.9
Underweight (Mild thinness)	17.0–18.4
Normal range	18.5–24.9
Overweight (Pre-obese)	25.0–29.9
Obese (Class I)	30.0–34.9
Obese (Class II)	35.0–39.9
Obese (Class III)	≥ 40.0

TODO:

- Get categories of avtivity names:
                # "activity_name": "",
                # "activity_name": "generic",
                # "activity_name": "running",
                # "activity_name": "sedentary",
                # "activity_name": "walking",

- Check how many people are obese in each group using BMI
- Make a function to select a number of patients from each group with similar background (age, BMI)
- Check their activity rate from a specific dates (can make a slider to change chosen timeframe)
- Compare 


Method: Select X sample from each group with similar background. Plot their glucose during specific 
timestamp
